### Exercise 3 ###
### Numbers and Math ###

print "I will now count my chickens:"

print "Hens", 25 + 30 / 6
print "Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

print "Now I will count the eggs:"

print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6 # Example here uses modulo. Modulo finds the remaineder of the division

# Module Example:
# Module of 7 % 3 is: 1
print 7 % 3

# Example of a Boolean
print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"
print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7

# More examples of Booleans
print "What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2
print "What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7

print "Oh, that's why it's False"
print "How about some more."

print "Is is it greater?", 5 > -2
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2
print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2

### Study Drills ###
# Example of more math. Rounds to whole numbers

print 'Input of: 7/3 = ', 7/3
print 'vs.'
print 'Input of: 7.0/3.0 = ', 7.0/3.0

### Order of Operations ###
# PEMDAS
# Stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction
# Order of operations for Math in the U.S.A and in Python
